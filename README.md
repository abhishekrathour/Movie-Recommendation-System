# Movie-Recommendation-System
 We will be building a content based recommendation engine using Python and Scikitlearn. We will cover concepts such as cosine distance, euclidean distance and when to use each of them. Finally, we will use IMDB 5000 movie dataset to build a content based recommendation engine using CountVectorize and Cosine similarity scores between movies.
